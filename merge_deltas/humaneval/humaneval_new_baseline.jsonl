It maintains a `current_max` variable that stores the maximum value encountered so far. For each number, it checks if it is greater than `current_max`. If it is, `current_max` is updated to this new value. Regardless, the `current_max` is appended to the `rolling_maxes` list, which is returned at the end of the function.\n\nThis approach ensures that at any point in the list, the corresponding element in the `rolling_maxes` list represents the maximum value encountered up to that point in the original list."}

This algorithm repeatedly applies the operation of replacing the larger number by its difference with the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero.

These examples serve as both documentation and tests that can be run using Python's built-in `doctest` module.\n- The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block checks if the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module).

Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    factors = []  # List to store the prime factors\n    divisor = 2  # The first prime number\n\n    while divisor * divisor <= n:  # No need to check beyond the square root of n\n        while n % divisor == 0:  # While n is divisible by the divisor\n            factors.append(divisor)  # Add the divisor to the list of factors\n            n \/\/= divisor  # Divide n by the divisor\n        divisor += 1  # Move to the next potential divisor\n\n    # If n is greater than 1, it means n is a prime number greater than the square root of the original n\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)  # Add the remaining prime number to the list of factors\n\n    return factors\n\n# Example usage\nn = 100\nprint(factorize(n))  # Output: [2, 2, 5, 5]\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n- It starts with the smallest prime factor, 2.\n- It divides `n` by this factor as long as `n` is divisible by it, each time adding the factor to the list of factors.\n- Once `n` is no longer divisible by the current factor, the function moves to the next potential factor.\n- This process continues until the divisor squared is greater than `n`, ensuring all factors are checked up to the square root of `n`.\n- If, after this process, `n` is greater than 1, `n` itself is a prime factor and is added to the list of factors.\n- The function returns the list of prime factors of `n`."}

For example, using NumPy's `roots` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_zero(xs: list):\n    roots = np.roots(xs[::-1])  # np.roots expects coefficients from highest to lowest degree\n    real_roots = roots.real[abs(roots.imag)<1e-5]  # Filter out real roots\n    return real_roots[0]  # Return the first real root found\n\n# Now you can use find_zero as demonstrated above.\n```\n\nThis implementation is simplistic and assumes that there's at least one real root and that the polynomial is defined in a way that meets the function's requirements."}

However, the guarantee of a solution based on the largest non-zero coefficient isn't entirely clear without further mathematical context or constraints. In general, polynomials of even degree can have zero, one, or multiple real roots, and their behavior is influenced by all coefficients, not just the largest one.\n\nGiven these constraints, a general approach to finding a zero of a polynomial is to use numerical methods, such as Newton's method, the bisection method, or others. However, these methods do not guarantee finding all zeros, and their success might depend on the choice of the starting point (for methods like Newton's) or the initial interval (for methods like bisection).\n\nFor simplicity, I'll demonstrate an implementation using a numerical method (Newton's method) with some assumptions for starting points. This implementation will not strictly adhere to the requirement about the largest non-zero coefficient guaranteeing a solution, as that would require more specific mathematical conditions.\n\n```python\ndef poly(x, coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate a polynomial at x with given coefficients.\"\"\"\n    return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))\n\ndef poly_derivative(x, coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate the derivative of a polynomial at x with given coefficients.\"\"\"\n    return sum(i * c * x**(i-1) for i, c in enumerate(coeffs) if i > 0)\n\ndef find_zero(xs):\n    if len(xs) % 2 == 0:  # Ensure even number of coefficients\n        # Newton's method\n        x0 = 0.5  # Initial guess\n        for _ in range(100):  # Max 100 iterations\n            y = poly(x0, xs)\n            y_prime = poly_derivative(x0, xs)\n            if y_prime == 0:  # Avoid division by zero\n                return None\n            x1 = x0 - y \/ y_prime\n            if abs(x1 - x0) < 1e-6:  # Convergence criterion\n                return x1\n            x0 = x1\n    return None  # Return None if no solution found or invalid input\n\n# Example usage\ncoeffs = [1, 0, -2]  # Represents x^2 - 2 = 0, which has two solutions: sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2)\nprint(find_zero(coeffs))  # This might find one of the zeros, depending on the method and starting point\n```\n\nThis example uses Newton's method to find a zero of the polynomial defined by the given coefficients. The choice of the initial guess (`x0`) and the convergence criteria are crucial for the success and accuracy of this method. Note that this implementation might not find a zero if the polynomial doesn't have real roots or if the initial guess is not suitable for convergence to a real root."}

The actual implementation of `encode_cyclic` might involve more complex logic, including handling uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, as well as potentially using a more complex cycle for encoding. Without the specifics of the `encode_cyclic` function, this is a general approach that might need adjustments to fit your exact scenario."}

Since the specific encoding function `encode_cyclic` is not provided, I'll assume a simple cyclic encoding mechanism for demonstration purposes. In this context, a cyclic encoding might involve shifting characters by a certain number of positions in the alphabet in a cyclic manner, with the shift value possibly changing in a predictable way throughout the string.\n\nGiven this assumption, let's implement a `decode_cyclic` function. This function will reverse the encoding process. For simplicity, let's assume the encoding involved shifting characters forward through the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary (e.g., 'z' would shift to 'a'), and that the shift value increased by 1 for each subsequent character (starting with a shift of 1 for the first character). The decoding process will need to reverse these shifts.\n\n```python\ndef decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:\n    decoded_chars = []\n    shift = 1  # Assuming the encoding started with a shift of 1 and increased by 1 for each character\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char.isalpha():  # Check if the character is a letter\n            # Determine the alphabet start ('a' or 'A') based on the case of the character\n            alpha_start = ord('a') if char.islower() else ord('A')\n            \n            # Calculate the original position of the character before encoding\n            original_pos = (ord(char) - alpha_start - shift) % 26 + alpha_start\n            \n            # Append the decoded character to the list\n            decoded_chars.append(chr(original_pos))\n        else:\n            # If the character is not a letter, it's assumed to be unchanged by the encoding\n            decoded_chars.append(char)\n        \n        shift += 1  # Increase the shift for the next character\n    \n    # Join and return the decoded characters as a string\n    return ''.join(decoded_chars)\n\n# Example usage\nencoded_string = \"ifmmp\"  # Assuming \"hello\" was encoded with a starting shift of 1\ndecoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)\nprint(decoded_string)  # Expected output: \"hello\"\n```\n\nThis example assumes a very specific encoding mechanism and might not match the actual `encode_cyclic` function you're referring to. If the encoding process involves different rules or complexities, you'll need to adjust the decoding logic accordingly. The key to decoding is understanding the exact rules used during encoding, such as how characters were shifted, whether the shift amount changed (and how it changed), and how non-alphabetic characters were handled."}

Extract the sorted numbers from the result.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef func(nums):\n    # Calculate the sum of digits for each number, considering the absolute value\n    def sum_of_digits(n):\n        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))\n    \n    # Attach each number's original index and its sum of digits\n    indexed_nums = [(index, num, sum_of_digits(num)) for index, num in enumerate(nums)]\n    \n    # Sort the numbers first by the sum of digits, then by their original index\n    sorted_nums = sorted(indexed_nums, key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0]))\n    \n    # Extract the sorted numbers\n    result = [num for _, num, _ in sorted_nums]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Test the function with the provided examples\nprint(func([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Expected: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\nprint(func([]))  # Expected: []\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n- It defines a helper function `sum_of_digits` to calculate the sum of digits of a number.\n- It creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains an index, the number itself, and the sum of its digits.\n- It sorts this list of tuples primarily by the sum of digits and secondarily by the original index to maintain the order for numbers with the same digit sum.\n- Finally, it extracts and returns the sorted list of numbers."}

However, the logic provided in the explanation was incorrect. The correct check is to see if `b_rotations` contains `a`, which is not the right approach for this problem. The correct approach is to see if `a` contains any rotation of `b`, which is achieved by checking if `b_rotations` (where `b` is concatenated with itself) is a substring of `a`."}

Return the word that finally holds the maximum number of unique characters, with the lexicographical order as a tiebreaker.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(words):\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters\n    max_unique_chars = 0\n    max_word = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words:\n        # Calculate the number of unique characters in the current word\n        unique_chars = len(set(word))\n        \n        # Check if the current word has more unique characters than the previous maximum\n        # Or if it has the same number but is lexicographically smaller\n        if unique_chars > max_unique_chars or (unique_chars == max_unique_chars and word < max_word):\n            max_unique_chars = unique_chars\n            max_word = word\n            \n    return max_word\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"alphabet\", \"aeroplane\", \"angle\", \"balloon\", \"candle\", \"zebra\"]\nprint(find_max(words))\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n- It iterates through each word in the list.\n- For each word, it calculates the number of unique characters by converting the word into a set (since sets cannot contain duplicates) and then getting the length of that set.\n- It then checks if the current word has more unique characters than the one stored as having the maximum. If they have the same number of unique characters, it checks which one comes first lexicographically.\n- Finally, it returns the word that has the maximum number of unique characters, using lexicographical order as a tiebreaker in case of a tie."}

For each number, it converts the number to a string to iterate through each digit. It then checks if the digit is even and not already included in the list of even digits. If so, it adds the digit to the list. Finally, it sorts the list of even digits in ascending order before returning it.\n\nPlease note, the original question seems to ask for even digits between two numbers, which might imply extracting unique even digits from the numbers within the range. The provided solution follows this interpretation. If the requirement was actually to list even numbers (not digits) between `a` and `b`, the solution would be simpler and not involve checking individual digits of numbers."}
